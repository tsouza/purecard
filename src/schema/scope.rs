//! The L2 scope-tracking state machine (`docs/spec/schema.md` §6.4).
//!
//! L1's byte-PDA surfaces only the *lexical* anchor (`AfterDot`, `ExpectSource`,
//! a comparison operator state); it cannot know which class a `$var` is bound to,
//! the class a navigation has reached, or whether the pipeline has become a
//! relation — the context-sensitive facts §6.1 forbids a PDA from carrying. The
//! [`ScopeTracker`] threads that small typed scope through the parse **in
//! lockstep** with the byte-PDA (advanced token-by-token from
//! [`DecoderSession`](crate::DecoderSession)), and at each identifier/operand
//! position yields an [`L2Position`] the narrower keys on.
//!
//! It never widens: an unresolved or unknown scope yields
//! [`L2Position::None`] (pass-through), so a position the tracker cannot type is
//! left exactly as L1 allowed it.
