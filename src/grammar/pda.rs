//! The byte-level pushdown automaton for the emitted-Pure grammar (§5).
//!
//! This is the live automaton: an explicit, hand-written state machine, not a
//! compiled EBNF table (see `specs/m1-l1-grammar.md`, *Design*). [`step`] is a
//! **pure** transition function — `(state, stack_top, byte) -> `[`Step`] — with no
//! I/O, allocation, or hidden state; [`Pda`] is the thin mutable driver that
//! applies each [`Step`] to a state field and a [`Frame`] stack.
//!
//! ## Shape of the recognizer
//!
//! The grammar is a *pipeline of terms*: `source ( "->" step )*`, where a term is
//! an identifier / classpath, a literal, a `$`-var navigation, a lambda, a list,
//! or a parenthesised sub-expression. Rather than one state per named production,
//! the automaton lexes byte-by-byte around the value hubs — [`State::ExpectValue`]
//! / [`State::ExpectValueReq`] (at the start of a term) and [`State::AfterValue`]
//! (having just completed one) — and defers all delimiter nesting to the [`Frame`]
//! stack. The machine is a *deliberate, residual* over-approximation of §5: it
//! still admits strings the compiler rejects — arithmetic/`if` type coherence,
//! projected-column vs name-count equality, typed-binder multiplicity — but those
//! are exactly, and only, the escapes §5.6 enumerates. §5.6 does **not** sanction
//! dropping the `source` production, the `->` connector between steps, keyword
//! terminals, operator arity, or literal well-formedness, and the machine does not
//! drop them: a query must open with `|`/`{|` on an *identifier source*; a
//! completed term is followed by `->`/`.`/`::`/`(`/an operator/a closer (never a
//! bare abutting identifier outside a `let` binder); every binary operator demands
//! an operand; numeric and date literals are well-formed; brackets balance against
//! the matching opener; strings close on an un-doubled quote; and `$`/`.`/`->`/`:`
//! each demand the token that may follow. Because neither soundness (100% by
//! construction over all-gold), coverage, nor mutation can *observe*
//! over-acceptance, this precision is pinned externally: by the negative reject
//! corpus (`tests/precision_reject.rs`) and the seeded completeness walker
//! (§8.2/G3/T8). This comment must not be read to excuse a widening beyond §5.6.
//!
//! Multi-byte operators (`->`, `::`, `==`, `&&`, `||` vs. the lambda `|`, …) are
//! recognised by a "saw first byte" state that consults the *next* byte and, when
//! the second byte does not complete the operator, **delegates** it back into the
//! hub state it belongs to by re-invoking [`step`]. That delegation is what keeps
//! the machine a true byte-at-a-time recogniser without any look-ahead buffer.
