description: Run the periodic rot sweep — deterministic L1 tools, then LLM judgment on the residue.

Use the **`rot-sweep`** skill to run a deep audit${ARGUMENTS:+ scoped to `$ARGUMENTS`}.

1. **L1 (deterministic, run first):** `just sweep` — cargo-machete, ast-grep,
   dylint, duplication, complexity, postponed-marker. Fix or file everything it
   surfaces before spending any LLM budget.
2. **L2 (LLM judgment on the residue only):** semantic DRY, nonsense/dead intent,
   design smells (leaky layers, god-objects). Do not re-derive anything L1 already
   decides.
3. **Record** each material finding in `docs/lessons.md` with date, trigger
   (L1 tool vs. L2), confidence, and action.
4. **Promote** any finding class seen `N=3` times into a new L1 rule (ast-grep
   pattern or dylint lint) with a test, and note the promotion in
   `docs/lessons.md`.

Report: L1 findings (fixed/filed), L2 residue with confidence, lessons.md entries
added, and any rule promoted this sweep.
