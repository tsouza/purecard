# Methodology: Spec-Driven Development

The kit ships domain-agnostic. Nothing about *what* the server does is assumed, so
the "what" has to enter deliberately and be written down before code is written.
That entry happens in exactly three places, and spec-driven development is how they
connect to a change.

## Where the "what" lives

1. **[`constitution.md`](../../constitution.md)** — the non-negotiable domain
   rules. Stable, high-level, PROTECTED where it needs to be. The invariants that
   hold across *every* feature.
2. **`specs/<name>.md`** — the per-feature spec. The concrete "what" for one
   change: the behavior, the acceptance criteria, the edge cases.
3. **[`domain-model.md`](../domain-model.md)** — the evolving elaboration of the
   domain: entities, workflows, invariants, vocabulary. Grows one feature at a
   time.

Code is downstream of all three. The generator implements *to* them; the reviewer
checks *against* them.

## The `/spec` flow

A feature moves through three phases, driven by `/spec` and scaffolded by
`just spec <name>`:

### plan

Turn the spec into an approach *before* writing code. Read the constitution and
the current domain model, identify the entities and invariants involved, decide
where each piece lands in the layering (`domain → app → infra → server`), and name
the tests that will prove it. Surface open questions here, not mid-implementation.

### implement

Write the code and tests against the plan, in a dedicated worktree, obeying the
constitution. The domain model and lessons are updated *in the same change* when
the work teaches us something new about the "what."

### verify

Run the change through `just ci` (the fast local gate — see
[testing.md](testing.md); the heavier coverage/mutation/audit gates run as
separate CI jobs), then the reviewer. The **reviewer checks the diff against the spec**: does the code
do what the spec said, no less and no more? Scope creep, missing acceptance
criteria, and unrequested behavior are all review findings. A change that passes
its tests but drifts from its spec does not merge.

## Writing a spec

A good spec is short and testable. It should state:

- **Goal** — what capability this adds, in one or two sentences.
- **Behavior** — the observable contract: inputs, outputs, and the HTTP/gRPC
  surface if any.
- **Acceptance criteria** — a checklist the reviewer and the tests can both
  evaluate. If a criterion can't be turned into a test, sharpen it until it can.
- **Invariants touched** — which domain-model invariants this relies on or
  introduces (and thus what must be enforced in `domain` types).
- **Out of scope** — what this change deliberately does *not* do, so "not done" is
  distinguished from "not intended."
- **Open questions** — anything needing a human or a decision (possibly an ADR).

No filler. A spec that restates the obvious wastes the reviewer's attention, which
is the scarcest thing in the loop.

## Why spec-first

Three payoffs, each central to the kit:

- **The reviewer gets an oracle.** "Does the diff match the spec?" is a far
  sharper question than "is this good?" — it turns review from taste into
  verification.
- **Scope stays honest.** With "out of scope" written down, the fold-vs-branch
  call on pre-existing issues has a reference point, and scope creep is visible.
- **The domain accumulates.** Specs are the mechanism by which
  `domain-model.md` and the constitution's domain section grow — deliberately,
  reviewably, one feature at a time — instead of the "what" living only in the
  agent's head for one session.
