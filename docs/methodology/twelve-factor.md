# The twelve-factor methodology

A *server* built with this kit is a [twelve-factor](https://12factor.net)
application, and not just for configuration — **every factor is load-bearing**.
A factor it violates is a defect, the same as a failed test, because
each one is what lets the process be run, scaled, and disposed of anywhere
without special handling.

This is the authoritative statement of how each factor is realized and enforced.
It is domain-agnostic: it names the *shape* each factor takes here, not any
particular application's realization. **PureCard — the decoder this kit currently
builds — is a pure library plus a feature-gated PyO3 boundary: no network service,
no process to bind or drain, no backing store.** It therefore realizes only the
subset of the twelve factors a *library* can: **I** (codebase), **II**
(dependencies), **XI** (logs, via `tracing`), and **XII** (admin, via
`xtask`/`just`) — plus **V** (build/release/run) *partially*, via the release-plz +
maturin-wheel pipeline whose first release is still held. The server-only factors —
backing services, processes, port binding, concurrency, disposability/shutdown,
and container-backed dev/prod parity — are **not implemented for a library**;
the table marks their enforcement **Future**, naming the shape each will take when
this kit grows a server, not a guarantee PureCard provides today. Config (III) is
likewise a pattern that activates the moment the library grows its first env
setting. The table grows through reviewer-approved PRs like the rest of the
ledger — as an application gains a config surface, backing services, and a
shutdown path, the corresponding rows gain their concrete enforcement.

| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I    | **Codebase** — one codebase, many deploys                    | One git repo; one change → one worktree → one PR                                                         | constitution §2                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| II   | **Dependencies** — explicit and isolated                     | `Cargo.toml` + `Cargo.lock`; every pin is latest-stable-verified and vetted                              | constitution §2/§4, `cargo deny`                                                                                                                                                                     |
| III  | **Config** — in the environment                              | Every setting loads from the environment through one config struct; nothing baked into the image         | **Future** (no env config yet) — the generated config reference + its drift test (below)                                                                                                             |
| IV   | **Backing services** — attached resources                    | Any attached resource (database, queue, object store) is bound by URL/creds at run, swappable in code    | **Future** (library has no backing service) — the `infra` layer boundary                                                                                                                             |
| V    | **Build, release, run** — strict separation                  | Crate + wheel build → immutable published release → downstream import/run; no build-time config baked in | **Partial** — the release pipeline (release-plz + the maturin wheel) separates build from an immutable published release; the first release is held, so the mechanism is wired but not yet exercised |
| VI   | **Processes** — stateless, share-nothing                     | The process holds nothing durable; state lives in a backing service, so any process serves any request   | **Future** (no process/server) — the layering (state lives in `infra`, not `app`)                                                                                                                    |
| VII  | **Port binding** — export services via port binding          | The server binds its own port and exports its service directly, with no injected external webserver      | **Future** (no server) — the `server` crate's entry point                                                                                                                                            |
| VIII | **Concurrency** — scale out via the process model            | Scale by adding stateless processes; the process is the unit of scale                                    | **Future** (no process model) — the stateless-process design                                                                                                                                         |
| IX   | **Disposability** — fast startup, graceful shutdown          | Fast startup; on SIGTERM the process drains in-flight work before exit, losing nothing                   | **Future** (no process to drain) — the shutdown handler                                                                                                                                              |
| X    | **Dev/prod parity** — keep environments similar              | Dev and CI exercise the *real* dependencies in throwaway containers, not mocks standing in for them      | **Future** (no product backing services; the engine lane's containers are oracle-test infra) — integration tests (`testcontainers`), e2e                                                             |
| XI   | **Logs** — treat as event streams                            | Structured `tracing` to stdout only; never a log file, never `println!`                                  | constitution §1                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| XII  | **Admin processes** — run one-off admin as one-off processes | One-off admin tasks are `cargo xtask` subcommands and `just` targets, not endpoints                      | `xtask`, `just` targets                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Config, specifically

Factor III is the one with the most surface area, so it has its own machinery.
The pattern — apply it the moment the application grows its first setting — is what
keeps configuration honest:

- **One source of truth.** A single config struct declares every setting with
  its env var name, default, and a doc-comment. Nothing reads the environment
  ad hoc; a setting that isn't a field on the struct doesn't exist.
- **Self-documenting.** The configuration reference — a single page a human reads
  to learn every knob — is **generated** from that struct, not hand-written.
- **Verifiable.** A `*_doc_stays_current` test (run in CI) regenerates the
  reference and fails if the checked-in copy has drifted, so the reference can
  **never lie**. Regenerate it with the generator `just` target.

Adding a setting means adding a field to the struct and regenerating — the doc,
the env var, and the default all follow from the one declaration. This is the
same "a figure a doc cites must be machine-asserted against its source, not
hand-copied" principle the lessons ledger records: the config reference is a
generated figure, and its drift test is what stops it rotting.
