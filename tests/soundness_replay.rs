//! The M1 soundness killer-test (`docs/spec/testing.md` §8.1, `specs/m1-l1-grammar.md` G2).
//!
//! This drives the **real** shipped byte-PDA — [`purecard::DecoderSession`] — over
//! every gold `pure_text` value one byte at a time, and asserts the killer
//! property: the recogniser never reaches a dead state on a byte a gold query
//! actually emits, and is in an accepting state at end-of-stream. Because the
//! corpus is execution-verified gold, a dead state is not a test failure to work
//! around — it names a construct the grammar wrongly forbids, to be fixed in the
//! PDA (§8.6, the oracle-driven tightening loop), never by weakening the
//! assertion.
//!
//! The corpus is partitioned by [`Envelope`], and each partition's record count is
//! asserted against an exact named constant so shrinkage, corruption, or a
//! mis-partitioned query all redden the gate.
