#![cfg(feature = "legend")]
//! Engine-backed completeness lane — opt-in (`docs/spec/testing.md` §8.2, §14.4).
//!
//! Compiled and run ONLY under `--features legend` (via `just test-legend`)
//! against a live Legend stack. The entire compilation unit is absent from the
//! default build graph, so the hermetic `just ci` gate never collects it — no
//! `#[ignore]`, no runtime skip, no weakened assertion.

/// done-criterion): the generated walk corpus is non-trivial and *every* walk
/// round-trips to a live engine and comes back classified — the walk→engine
/// plumbing is real and the generator feeds it.
///
/// What remains OUTSTANDING (documented, not silently skipped): the *100%
/// compile-rate* clause of G3. Of the two pieces it needs, the L2 schema overlay
/// now exists (M3), so a schema-constrained walker can name classes and
/// properties that resolve; the remaining gap is (1) the §14.2 `grammarToJson`
/// lowering that turns a raw emitted-Pure string into the engine's
/// `ValueSpecification` JSON (spec risk R4 — still open, the fixtures are still
/// placeholders) and a schema-constrained walk generator wired onto it. Until
/// that lands, a compile-rate assertion would be dishonest over the current
/// placeholder fixtures, so this lane asserts reachability + classification and
/// leaves the rate to that follow-on work.
