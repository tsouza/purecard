//! The shared row type for the fused-nav-dot precision fixture
//! (`tests/fixtures/tokenizers/fused_precision.jsonl`).
//!
//! One row is one real-tokenizer case: the byte-level token strings a real
//! byte-level-BPE tokenizer emits for a legal/phantom member navigation, with the
//! index of the single token that fuses the navigation `.` with the member's first
//! character. The hermetic Tier-A replay (`fused_tokenizer_precision.rs`, default
//! features, no tokenizer crate) deserializes it and drives it through the shipped
//! decoder; the feature-gated Tier-B extractor (`fused_tokenizer_extract.rs`)
//! serializes it from the *actual* tokenizers and diffs, so the fixture cannot rot.
//! Both lanes share this one definition (constitution §4, DRY).
