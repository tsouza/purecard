//! Seeded accepting-walk generator for the byte-PDA (`specs/m1-l1-grammar.md` T8,
//! G3; `docs/spec/testing.md` §8.2).
//!
//! The recognizer is `Clone` and leaves itself unchanged on a dead byte
//! ([`Pda::advance`] doc), so the *language* it accepts can be sampled by
//! clone-and-probe: at each position, try every byte of a representative alphabet
//! on a clone, keep the ones the automaton accepts, and pick one with a seeded
//! PRNG. Growing then closing (openers are disabled once a per-walk length target
//! is reached) drives every walk to an accepting configuration in bounded steps.
//!
//! The generator is fully deterministic — committed seeds, a committed
//! SplitMix64 — so a walk set is reproducible in CI (constitution §2, no
//! local-only state) and identical across runs. Its output feeds two lanes: the
//! hermetic `completeness_walks` self-test (every walk must stream through the
//! shipped [`DecoderSession`]) and the opt-in `legend` engine lane.
