// CI log-sweep: fail if any job in this run logged an un-allowlisted warning.
//
// This is the net under everything else. clippy and rustdoc already fail on
// their own warnings via `-D warnings`, but tools without a native -Werror
// (docker build, apt, useradd, …) can print a warning while still exiting 0 — so
// a warning could otherwise slip through a green run. This gate reads the run's
// logs and fails on any tool warning, wherever it came from, enforcing
// constitution §2 ("warnings are errors") across *every* CI job at once.
//
// Logs are fetched per-job, not via the run's aggregated archive: `gh run view
// --log` serves that archive, which GitHub only publishes once the whole run
// finishes — but this sweep runs *inside* the run (needs: all jobs, if:
// always()), so the archive doesn't exist yet. Each finished job's own log is
// available the moment that job completes; jobs still in flight (this one and
// ci-gate) have a null conclusion and are skipped.
//

// deprecated Node runtime). Benign near-misses — counts like "0 warnings", the
// `-D warnings` flag, and Node's `DeprecationWarning:` — have no bare-word
// `warning:` boundary and no `##[`/`::` prefix, so they don't match.

// is a deliberate, documented exception — never a way to silence a real warning

    // prefix). The save is best-effort and non-fatal — the winning job stores the
    // cache — so the annotation is a transient of concurrency, not a code or tool
    // defect we can fix at a source. It is not suppressible without disabling the
    // cache. Matched narrowly by the toolkit's exact retry wording so no real
    // warning is caught.
